virginia tech corps of cadets, open to all students, is a university program dedicated to developing tomorrow’s leaders. while participating in a full-time military academic lifestyle, cadets hone their leadership, time-management, and decision-making skills. students who have exceptional leadership qualities, as demonstrated through a record of leadership in extracurricular activities, student and civic organizations, athletic teams, or successful employment prior to college, and who are interested in enrolling in the corps of cadets, may be given additional consideration in the admissions process. however, please note that applying to the university and designating on your application your intent to enroll as a cadet is a serious commitment to the virginia tech corps of cadets. the admissions committee reserves the right to reevaluate your admission status if you request a change to civilian status after you have been offered admission as a cadet. if you must become exempt from cadet status due to personal, health, or other reasons, situations will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. students who were admitted to the corps may request a change to civilian status by emailing appchange@vt.edu , but there is a possibility that the request will be denied if the student received additional consideration in the process as a cadet applicant.  the change request should include a detailed explanation. all cadets will need to speak with the corps' recruiting officer before admissions will decide whether to approve the request. the student will be emailed a decision as to whether the offer of admission is contingent on remaining in the corps of cadets. if approved to change to civilian status, the student will need to pay the application fee, which was waived when applying as a cadet. to pay the non-refundable fee, please mail a check made payable to: treasurer of virginia tech to the office of undergraduate admissions 925 prices fork road blacksburg, va 24061 (us) once a student enrolls in the corps, they are committed for approximately 7 weeks: new cadet week and the first six weeks of school.  after 7 weeks, if civilian housing is available, a student can switch to civilian status but must forfeit any corps scholarships and pay approximately $1100 worth of uniform costs. there is no military obligation for cadets in the corps. all students can enter the corps as a freshman, sophomore, or even junior year.  however, if interested in the air force or naval rotc, students should plan to enter no later than sophomore year. in addition to their chosen academic track, cadets also have the opportunity to receive a minor in leadership through the corps of cadets leader development program. cadets are not required to participate in rotc, but all rotc students must be members of the corps. all cadets (except juniors or seniors living with their spouses) are required to live in cadet residence halls unless excused by the commandant. the corps offers scholarships that do not require military service; the rotc programs offer some scholarships that do. for more information, contact the commandant of cadets 141 lane hall virginia tech
