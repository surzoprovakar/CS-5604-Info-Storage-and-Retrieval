not assume that it will be possible to be force-added into the course a second time. even if a student submits a force-add request for a cs course, the student should still continue to try to add it through the drop/add mechanism when it is available. drop/add & course request dates if you get a message saying you need permission when you click on the force-add survey link, please open an incognito window, sign into your vt email and try again. the permission is linked to your vt email address. if you have decided that you no longer need or want the course you submitted a force-add request for, please use the link below to cancel your request. if you are able to enroll in the course through drop/add, please cancel your request. cs minors requests from cs minors may be denied if
