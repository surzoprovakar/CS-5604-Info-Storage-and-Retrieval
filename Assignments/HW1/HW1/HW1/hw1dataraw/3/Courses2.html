(historically, these numbers came from an attempt to use the second digit of the course number to indicate topic, but that concept broke down years ago.) none of these areas should be considered to be more or less priviliged than any other (though due to grad school requirements on graduate degrees, we do require all students entering during or after 2019 to take a course from area 0). anticipated graduate course offerings for the next two academic years are available here . a listing of current cs advanced topics and special study graduate courses can be found here . in addition to the courses listed below, graduate students may also take a limited number of the 4000-level courses listed here . the list of approved cognate courses is available here . course id course name area cs5014
