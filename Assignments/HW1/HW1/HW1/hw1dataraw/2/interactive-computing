home research research areas interactive computing about faculty research groups/events related news interacting with computers is an important part of modern life, from driving a car safely to using all the features your phone can deliver, to being able to work productively and creatively. interactive computing studies how computers and people can cooperate effectively on any number of tasks. our work targets problems in social computing, design and creativity, decision making, intelligent systems, and cognitive modeling. for example, we study the transparency of algorithms controlling social media feeds, the use of robotics in domestic environments to support aging in place, and the application of crowdsourcing for creative work. working at times with companies like adobe, facebook, google, intel, microsoft, nvidia, and tableau, our research synthesizes knowledge from machine learning, psychology, design, and the learning sciences to study and address important problems in society. we also work on the presentation of and interaction with information, ranging from dashboards of visualizations to vr displays of photorealistic video games. faculty & affiliate faculty brian
