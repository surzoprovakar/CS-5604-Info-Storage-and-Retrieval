home research research areas scientific computing about faculty research groups/events related news simulation plays a major role in nearly every area of science and engineering—from data analysis to physical models. our faculty design, build, and analyze the behavior of numerical algorithms to ensure that numerical methods are accurate and that implementations are efficient. we design and analyze the accuracy of methods, developing numerical approximations to partial differential equations with advanced finite element methods and integral equations. we also develop solvers for these problems, including techniques based on numerical linear algebra, iterative subspace methods, and multigrid methods. our research explores the efficiency of these methods on a range of architectures and environments, from high-concurrency nodes, such as gpus, to large-scale supercomputing systems. we explore parallel scalability and analyze performance in computing kernels from graph algorithms to sparse linear algebra. faculty & affiliate faculty nancy m. amato parallel algorithms and libraries, parallel graph algorithms, performance modeling mark a. anastasio, department of bioengineering
