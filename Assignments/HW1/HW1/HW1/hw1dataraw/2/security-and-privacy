home research research areas security and privacy about faculty research groups/events related news at the same time society is increasingly relying on computers, a diverse array of adversaries are exploiting security vulnerabilities in these systems to compromise critical assets. there are also rising privacy concerns about how pervasive collection of data about individuals can be used to predict and manipulate their behavior. illinois security and privacy faculty address security and privacy concerns with both theoretical and applied approaches. they address security of computer and communication systems including: operating systems; auditing and data provenance; the internet, wireless networks, and the “internet of things”; cloud computing; approximate computing; quality and resource management; and mobile computing. they also explore techniques related to security and privacy in a data science context such as: technologies for privacy-preserving data sharing based on cryptography, hardware, or generative models; distributed systems, crypto-currencies,  and blockchains; adversarial machine learning; secure computation, zero-knowledge verifiable outsourcing, and related cryptography. these and other techniques are applied to a wide range of applications including: multi-sensory systems and multimedia; human factors and socio-technical considerations; power grids, autonomous vehicles and other cyber-physical systems; healthcare and genomics. faculty & affiliate faculty vikram adve secure compilation, program analysis, software security, debloating
