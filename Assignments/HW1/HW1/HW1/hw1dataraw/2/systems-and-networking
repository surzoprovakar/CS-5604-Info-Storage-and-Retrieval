home research research areas systems and networking about faculty research groups/events related news working on problems that are directly relevant to industry, our faculty are advancing the state of the art in cloud computing and systems for big data, software defined networks, wired and datacenter networking, internet of things, wearable computing, mobile computing, multimedia systems, security, privacy, health-care engineering systems, and cyber-physical systems. we work collaboratively with industry partners including google, microsoft, at&t, hp, and many others. our research has also resulted in the creation of several startup companies. we produce creative and innovative students who become faculty at top-ranked schools, researchers at prestigious labs, and who join cutting-edge companies. our courses are not just available to on-campus students, but a selection of them are also offered to off-campus students through coursera moocs with enrollment numbers in the hundreds of thousands. faculty & affiliate faculty tarek abdelzaher networked sensing; intelligent internet-of-things (iot) applications; iot and big data;  embedded (cyber-physical) and real-time systems;
