university, 2001 biography kevin c. chang is a professor in computer science, university of illinois at urbana-champaign . he received a bs from national taiwan university and phd from stanford university , in electrical engineering. his research addresses large scale information access, for search, mining, and integration across structured and unstructured big data, with current focuses on "entity-centric" web search/mining and social media analytics. he received two best paper selections in vldb 2000 and 2013, an nsf career award in 2002, an ncsa faculty fellow award in 2003, ibm faculty awards in 2004 and 2005, academy for entrepreneurial leadership faculty fellow award in 2008, and the incomplete list of excellent teachers at university of illinois in 2001, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2010, and 2011. he is passionate to bring research results to the real world and, with his students, co-founded cazoodle , a startup from the university of illinois, for deepening vertical "data-aware" search over the web. professional highlights pc members,  sigmod, vldb, icde, kdd, edbt, icdm, www, asonam, sigir, wsdm, cikm, aaai,  recent years. associate editor,  proceedings of the

department of uiuc. our research overall aims at bridging structured and unstructured big data --- to bring structured/semantic-rich access to the myriad and massive unstructured data which accounts for most of the world's information. therefore, our research spans across data mining, data management/databases , information retrieval, machine learning , with current efforts focusing on interactive data management , entity-centric web search and mining , social media analytics, and social network mining . as our objectives, we aim at developing novel systems, principled algorithms, and formal theories that ultimately deliver real world applications. as our approaches, we seek to be inspired by and learn from the data we are tackling-- i.e., we believe the key to tame big data is to learn the wisdom hidden in the large scale of the data. graduate research opportunities i am looking for phd/ms students to join the research project at the forward lab . our current projects studies theories and algorithms as well as build systems for real world data management applications for web search/mining and social media analytics. take a look at our recent publications to see what we work on. undergraduate research opportunities our forward lab welcome undergraduate students to participate in research with us. you will join our projects to work with graduate students for design algorithms and implement systems in data management, data mining, and social media/network analytics. research interests data mining, database systems, machine learning, information retrieval,
