theoretical computer science studies the foundations computing from a rigorous and mathematical point of view. core topics include models of computing, design and analysis of algorithms, data structures, protocols and mechanisms, and lower bounds. our faculty study algorithms in many diverse areas (computational geometry & topology, graphs, optimization, approximation, randomization), data structures, cryptography and secure computation, economics and computation, complexity theory, foundations of machine learning, and applications to several areas including operations research, computational biology, parallel & distributed computing, and networking to name a few. our research, in addition to its fundamental importance, has many near and long term applications in computer science and beyond. faculty & affiliate faculty nancy m. amato geometry, parallel algorithms, computational biology timothy chan computational geometry, algorithms, data structures karthik
