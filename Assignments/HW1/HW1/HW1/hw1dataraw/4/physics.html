and winter sessions experiential learning living-learning programs study abroad physics physicists seek to understand nature at the most fundamental and quantitative level. the physics curriculum provides a broad background in scientific inquiry, quantitative problem solving, emerging research frontiers, and communication skills. students can pursue either a b.s. or a b.a. according to their career goals. the b.s. is recommended for students interested in graduate study or in leadership or technical positions in industry or government. it may lead to a 5-year b.s./m.s. for qualified students.the b.a. allows students to pursue a more flexible program with a strong background in physics. it is ideal for students interested in science-education certification or as a pre-med or pre-law degree. students are strongly encouraged to participate in undergraduate research opportunities. many of these projects are highly interdisciplinary. internships and study-abroad experiences can be arranged. the department offers excellent computer facilities and a student machine shop. major options physics education pre-health pre-law contact: diane walker-green 540-231-5792
