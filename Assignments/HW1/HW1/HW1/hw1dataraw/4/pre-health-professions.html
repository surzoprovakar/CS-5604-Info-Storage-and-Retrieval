schools as long as students satisfy admission requirements. although many pre-health professions students tend to major in scientific disciplines (biochemistry; biology; chemistry; engineering; human

holistically. most medical and dental schools and other health professions programs include the following college courses among their admission requirements: mathematics biology + lab biochemistry english general chemistry + lab organic chemistry + lab physics + lab specific prerequisites vary slightly among the medical and dental schools. the student should review the prerequisites for the specific school(s) of their interest to make certain all such courses have been accounted for by the time of application. most health professional schools require students to take a standardized admissions test. normally students take this test in the spring of the year they plan to apply to their professional school. students take the dental admission test (dat) for dental schools, medical college admission test (mcat) for medical schools, optometry admission test (oat) for optometry schools, pharmacy college admission test (pcat) for pharmacy schools, and the graduate record examination (gre) for most of the other health professions. additional information for individual schools are found on their respective web sites. contact: health professions advising 540-231-7287
