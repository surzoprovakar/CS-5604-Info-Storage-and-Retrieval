professional education summer and winter sessions experiential learning living-learning programs study abroad sociology the sociology major is the study of our social world and how different groups of people shape human behavior. because all human behavior is social behavior, sociologists study a range of topics from two-person relationships to global communities. courses include important social issues such as race and gender inequality, poverty, mental health, crime, sexual identities, and issues of ageism and ableism. there are five degree options to choose from in this program: africana studies, american indian studies, social inequality, research methods, and women’s and gender studies. students often gain experience through internships in human services, counseling, criminal justice, education, business (for and non-profits), research/policy, and government. career options research analysts social workers police officers probation officers federal law enforcement officers
