computer science educates students in all aspects of computing, conducts cutting-edge research, and develops novel computing principles and technologies that positively impact the world. in pursuing these ends, we embrace the following common values that guide our decision making and enable our large community to thrive. we continuously strive for excellence, innovation, and positive impact in all our activities including education, research, and our work in the wider world. we believe that everyone in our community must have an opportunity to help define, shape, and lead the future of
