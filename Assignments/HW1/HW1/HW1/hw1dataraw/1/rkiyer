queensland, 1977 be     electrical engineering      university of queensland    1973 biography ravishankar k. iyer is george and ann fisher distinguished professor of engineering at the university of illinois at urbana-champaign. he holds joint appointments in the departments of electrical and computer engineering and computer science, in the coordinated science laboratory (csl), the national center for supercomputing applications, the carle illinois college of medicine, and the carl r. woese institute for genomic biology. he is also faculty research affiliate at the mayo clinic, and yeoh ghin seng distinguished visiting professor of the national university health system, singapore. professor iyer leads the depend group at csl, with a multidisciplinary focus on systems and software that combine deep measurement driven analytics and machine learning with applications in two important domains: i) trust (that spans resilience and the security of critical infrastructures) and ii) health (that spans computational genomics and health analytics focused on personalized medicine). the depend group has developed a rich ai analytics framework that has been deployed on real-world applications in collaborations with industry, health providers, and government agencies including nsf, nih, and dod. iyer directs the illinois/mayo nsf center for computational biotechnology and genomic medicine (ccbgm). professor iyer is a fellow of the american association for the advancement of science (aaas), the institute of electrical and electronics engineers (ieee), and the association for computing machinery (acm). he has received several awards, including the ieee emanuel r. piore award, and the 2011 outstanding contributions award by the association of computing machinery. professor iyer is also the recipient of the degree of doctor honoris causa from toulouse sabatier university in france. academic positions professor, carle illinois college of medicine
