theory research statement my main research interests lie in the areas of algorithmic game theory, mathematical economics, and in design of efficient algorithms. i am interested in exploring the computability of equilibria, both market and nash, under various settings, and also understanding the impact of strategic behavior in multi-agent situations. currently, i am exploring problems from dynamic matching, fair division of scarce resources, and market design for cloud computing. in addition i am exploring avenues for interdisciplinary applications of these tools to genetic evolution, machine learning and dynamical systems. research interests algorithmic game theory: equilibrium computation and complexity, smoothed analysis, learning in games strategic analysis of games and markets
