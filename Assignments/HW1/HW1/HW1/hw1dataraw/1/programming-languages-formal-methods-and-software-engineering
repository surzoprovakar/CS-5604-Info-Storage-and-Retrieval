faculty research groups/events related news the growing complexity and scale of software poses formidable challenges for reliability, security, performance, and productivity. our faculty tackle these problems by developing innovative techniques in programming language design and semantics; techniques and tools for formal verification, software testing, and automated debugging; and models and verification techniques for embedded systems that interact with physical entities. we are known for theoretical advances such as the actor model of concurrency ; rewriting logic and related semantic frameworks; concolic testing for automated test generation; automated logic reasoning; automated inference of specifications and invariants; and control-theoretic techniques for analyzing cyberphysical systems. we have also produced widely-used tools and techniques like the maude rewriting engine ; the llvm compiler infrastructure ; hpvm and approxhpvm systems for compiling and approximating programs running on heterogeneous systems; k framework ; probfuzz , psense , and axprof systems for testing probabilistic and randomized computations; the first complete formalizations of c, java, and javascript ; and regression testing techniques. faculty & affiliate faculty vikram adve programming languages, compilers, parallel programming, domain-specific languages, automated
