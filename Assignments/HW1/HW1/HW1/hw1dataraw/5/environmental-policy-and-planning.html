environmental policy and planning (epp) major provides students with an interdisciplinary framework to view environmental problems. students will obtain the knowledge and skills needed to function as policymakers and planners who can understand complex environmental issues and develop enduring solutions. while science and technology are critical to meeting this challenge, they must be supported by policies and plans responsive to diverse political, economic, sociocultural, institutional, and regulatory contexts. the epp major builds on the public and urban affairs (pua) degree core that provides students with foundational knowledge in policy, planning, governance, and international affairs. the epp major extends this knowledge through an interconnected sequence of courses that explore environmental policy and planning, land use, and environmental law. visit environmental policy and planning contact: chris laplante 540-231-3831 chrisl@vt.edu 205 architecture annex want to
