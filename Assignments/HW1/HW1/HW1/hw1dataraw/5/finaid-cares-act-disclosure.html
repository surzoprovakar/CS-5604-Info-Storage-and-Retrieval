·       received a subsidized loan or pell grant (but not both) in 2019-2020; ·       have fall 2020 enrolled hours as of july 29, 2020; and, ·       had not previously received the additional amount due to non-enrollment on june 18, received an increase of $210. graduate students who previously received less than $1,200; are enrolled for the fall 2020, received: an increase that takes their total cares award to $1,200 if previously received between $1,000 and $1,199; or, an increase of $300. undergraduate students who received a previous cares grant;
