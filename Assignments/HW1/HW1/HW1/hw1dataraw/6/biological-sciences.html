biological sciences is the study of life. our majors receive a broad education in the fundamentals of biology from the molecular scale to the global scale. students take required courses in genetics, cell and molecular biology, evolutionary biology and ecology, and then may choose elective courses in microbiology, botany, zoology, physiology, biotechnology, infectious disease, climate ecology, and cancer biology, to name just a few. biological sciences majors also complete courses in general chemistry, organic chemistry, mathematics, physics and statistics. the biological sciences curriculum prepares students for graduate school in a range of biological disciplines, as well as for professional schools in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, pharmacy and related fields. many students pursuing a b.s. degree in biological sciences find employment immediately upon graduation. to enhance professional development and employment potential, faculty members encourage students to participate in undergraduate research opportunities and/or relevant internships. major options biomedical ecology, evolution, and behavior educational contact: jack evans 540-231-6407
