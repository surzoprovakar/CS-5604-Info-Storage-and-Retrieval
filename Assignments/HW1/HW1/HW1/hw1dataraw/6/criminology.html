crime. we expose students to many theories of why crime occurs and examine the different ways that societies try to control crime. courses include hot topics such as issues of drug use, school bullying, policing, juvenile delinquency, and victimization. students often intern at a residential facility for juvenile delinquents, court system, or with local police departments. graduates have careers with the fbi, cia, atf, dea, and border patrol or work as a secret service agent, national security intelligence analyst, police officer, probation and parole officer, crime prevention program evaluator, director of non-profit organizations, and victim services counselor. the major also prepares students for graduate degrees in sociology, criminology, criminal justice, and law. employment in the field of criminology is consistently strong and growing. career options police officer u.s. marshal alcohol, tobacco, and firearms agent drug enforcement administration agent federal bureau of
