bachelor's degree in computer science is offered from the grainger college of engineering. see the degree and programs options page for a listing of the other degrees that we offer. the information on this page is for students entering in fall 2021 and beyond. students who entered prior to fall 2021 should see a cs academic advisor. see also: prerequisite flowchart and course planning forms

six additional technical electives with at least eighteen (18) cumulative credit hours and chosen from cs 397 and the 400-level cs courses, not including cs 400 , cs 401 , cs 402 , cs 403 or cs 491 . cs 500 -level courses may be used as technical electives, but only with special permission from the cs academic office. cs 397 and cs 499 may be used with a cumulative maximum of six (6) credits from them counting as technical electives. one "cs-like" course in another department (e.g., ece) may also be counted as a cs 400 -level course with permission of the cs academic office. non-cs tech electives will not be considered in focus areas. at least one (1) of the cs courses used for technical electives must be chosen from the list below of cs courses satisfying the team project requirement. team project course list: cs 417, cs 419 ( spring 2021 only ), cs 427, cs 428, cs 429, cs 437, cs 445 ( until spring 2018 ) , cs 465, cs 467, cs 493, cs 494, cs 497, cs 498 sections: virtual reality (spring 2018 until spring 2021 -- became cs 417), internet of things (fall 2019 until spring 2021--became cs 437 topic), ise - iot software engineering (fall 2020 until spring 2021--became cs 437 topic), game development. additional courses will be added upon department evaluation. note: courses transferred from other universities (including both study abroad and domestic universities) will not satisfy the team project requirement even if they are articulated as equivalents to the courses listed above. three of the cs courses must be chosen from a single focus area, from among the areas below, with additional 498s added as approved (note that inclusion in a focus group does not guarantee future offering for cs 498s): software foundations : 407 (was 498 applied

elective courses comprising at least six (6) credit hours. these advanced elective courses must be distinct from courses used to satisfy the technical electives. they may be chosen from cs 397 individual study and the 400-level coursework offered for letter grade in any area offered at the university of illinois at urbana-champaign.  (cs 491 and most other seminar courses do not count.)  it is expected that students will select these additional advanced courses in a way that best augments their program of study. consultation with a faculty mentors is highly encouraged. a maximum of six (6) credit hours of cs 397 may be used in the combination of technical electives and advanced electives. in addition, students have to complete a number of hours of free electives, which are courses beyond major and general education requirements that students complete to attain the 128 total hours required . caution: there are a few limitations on what students can take to complete free electives.  these limitations are spelled out on this page on the grainger college of engineering undergraduate advising wiki . prerequisite flowchart and course planning forms - b.s. in computer
