science visionary scholarship donors home research research areas bioinformatics and computational biology about faculty research groups/events related news tree of life diagram our researchers work on core computational biology-related problems, including genomics, proteomics, metagenomics, and phylogenomics. we develop novel techniques that combine ideas from mathematics, computer science, probability, statistics, and physics, and we help identify and formalize computational challenges in the biological domain, while experimentally validating novel hypotheses generated by our analyses. we are developing algorithms with improved accuracy for large-scale and complex estimation problems in phylogenomics (genome-scale phylogeny estimation), multiple sequence alignment, and metagenomics. we are exploring gene regulation—developing advanced techniques to predict the diverse function of noncoding parts of dna and to relate interspecies and interpersonal differences in dna to differences in the organism’s form and function. we work broadly in the development of machine learning techniques for computational biology, with research spanning the areas of molecular and structural biology; networks and systems biology; and molecular mechanisms of human disease. faculty & affiliate faculty nancy m. amato modeling molecular motions, protein folding, protein/ligand binding mohammed
