groups/events related news as we approach the end of moore’s law, and as mobile devices and cloud computing become pervasive, all aspects of system design—circuits, processors, memory, compilers, programming environments—must become more energy efficient, resilient, and programmable. blue waters supercomputer our research groups explore energy efficiency via low-voltage design techniques, specialized hardware accelerators, adaptive runtime techniques in high performance computing, efficient memory architectures for heterogeneous mobile systems, novel architectures for exascale systems, and other projects. we examine resilience through tolerating variation during chip fabrication, failure-tolerant processor architectures, scalable resilience protocols, and automated software debugging and recovery techniques. we explore programmability through architectural support for synchronization, automatic parallelization and vectorization, performance-portability for heterogeneous mobile systems, high-performance implementations of scripting languages, and highly scalable parallel run-time systems. in addition to collaborating with major companies on a wide range of research projects, our software artifacts like llvm and charm++ are widely used in industry, government labs, and academic research. faculty & affiliate faculty sarita v. adve computer architecture, parallel
