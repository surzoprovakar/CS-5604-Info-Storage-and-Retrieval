home research research areas artificial intelligence about faculty research groups/events related news the study of systems that behave intelligently, artificial intelligence includes several key areas where our facultyÂ are recognized leaders: computer vision, machine listening, natural language processing, machine learning and robotics. a snow dragon realistically inserted into a photograph. computer vision systems can understand images and video, for example, building extensive geometric and physical models of cities from video, or warning construction workers about nearby dangers. natural language processing systems understand written and spoken language; possibilities include automatic translation of text from one language to another, or understanding text on wikipedia to produce knowledge about the world. machine listening systems understand audio signals, with applications like speech recognition, acoustic monitoring, or trascribing polyphonic music automatically. crucial to modern artificial intelligence, machine learning methods exploit examples in order to adjust systems to work as effectively as possible. robotics puts artificial intelligence into practice using machines that perceive and interact with the physical world. faculty & affiliate faculty nancy m. amato robot motion and task planning, multi-agent systems, crowd simulation mark a. anastasio,
