chackoge@illinois.edu 2130 siebel center for comp sci for more information the ernie project research statement i am interested  in historiographic techniques, novelty in science, impact, and knowledge diffusion. a related interest is social interactions that drive scientific recognition and achievement.  i use open source computing technologies to analyze large datasets whose elements are linked by unique identifiers. scientific citations are central to these analyses. i place emphasis on any results being of value to at least one of four stakeholders: (i) research funders, who want to know what their support has achieved and what it might in future, (ii) research institutions who ask the same questions as funders but are recipients of funds and must strategize to sustain their existing support and/or augment it, (iii) providers of research analytical services who think beyond the confines of commonplace global metrics such as the h-index and its well documented limitations, and (iv) finally, the evaluation community itself.  more recently, my interests have drifted towards the identification and characterization of communities that form around research questions for which i am establishing new collaborations within and outside the department. research areas data and information systems selected articles in journals zhao, w., korobskiy, d., & chacko, g. delayed
