home research research areas data and information systems about faculty research groups/events related news the rapid growth of big data creates unprecedented demand and opportunities for developing powerful intelligent data and information systems that help people organize, search, analyze, and manage data, information and knowledge. our faculty work on a wide range of research problems, tackling the many challenges associated with developing such intelligent systems and their applications. research includes structuring and organizing massive data and information, helping people search and find relevant data and information; mining actionable knowledge from massive, heterogeneous typed data; optimizing the entire workflow of data access, analytics, and exploration; analyzing large social/information networks, optimizing human-computer collaboration centered on data, and exploring broad data-intensive applications. our faculty work closely with industry, and many of our algorithms are used in a wide range of information system applications, especially in database and data analytics systems, data mining systems, search engines, and web information service systems.
