bigdog@illinois.edu 355 wohlers hall for more information department of astronomy profile web site research statement my research is focused on the application of advanced computational  and statistical techniques to optimally extract knowledge to  astronomical data in an effort to better understand the universe in  which we live. specific application areas currently include: 1)  development and application of new statistical and machine learning   techniques to large astrophysical data. specific algorithms currently  include random forests, random atlas, hierarchical bayesian estimation,  and deep neural networks, while specific application areas include  source classification, image classification, and distance estimation. 2) development  and application of new cosmological measurement codes, in particular  n-point clustering measurements and the quantifying the constraints  these new measurements place on cosmological parameters and our  understanding of the growth of large scale structure. 3)  acceleration of learning and cosmological measurement codes by using new  hardware technologies. currently these efforts focus on the use of  multi- and many-core systems, gpus, and cloud-based systems. 4) identification and characterization of transient and variable phenomena in large photometric and spectroscopic data. these  projects primarily use photometric and spectroscopic data from the  sloan digital sky survey, the baryon acoustic oscillation spectroscopic  survey, and the dark energy survey, as well as several space-based  surveys. many of the techniques developed are also applicable to the  design and operation of the forthcoming large synoptic survey telescope. research areas data and information systems scientific computing
