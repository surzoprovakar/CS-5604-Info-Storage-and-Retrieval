co-founder ims consulting, expert witness for patent litigation, other professional activities girish's ongoing research interest is in theoretical insights and practical algorithms for adaptive autonomy, with a particular application focus on field-robotics and unmanned aerial systems (uas). he has authored over 90 peer reviewed publications in adaptive and fault tolerant control, sequential decision making and mission planning, aircraft system identification, distributed sensing and inference, bayesian nonparametric learning for control, and vision aided navigation and control. his recent research is focused on the immediate need to create software capable of adapting and learning from experience in various domains where distributed operation is essential, including agriculture, road-networks, energy, and defense. on the practical side, girish has led the development and flight-testing of over 10 research uas platform. uas autopilots based on girish’s work have been designed and flight-tested on six uass, including by independent international institutions. girish is a primary investigator on nsf, afosr, nasa, and doe grants. he is the winner of the air force young investigator award, and the aerospace guidance and controls systems committee dave ward memorial award. research interests machine learning for machine vision adaptive control and reinforcement
