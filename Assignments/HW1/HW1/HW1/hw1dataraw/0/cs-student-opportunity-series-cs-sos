mentorship program: wcs is excited to announce that we will be starting our bits and bytes mentorship program in the summer this year (before the 2021-2022 school year), so that we can provide incoming illinois cs students with tips and tricks essential to navigating their first years at uiuc. for those new to the program, each family consists of bits (mentees), bytes (mentors), and a family head (a wcs officer). there will be 3-4 bits in your family with 2 parent bytes. multiple families will be grouped together under a wcs officer to help organize cross-family activities! the families will continue on for the rest of the year, and wcs will provide programming so that families can meet one another frequently. to be a bit, you must be either a freshman, sophomore, or transfer student studying or interested in studying computer science at illinois. to be a byte, you must either be a sophomore, junior, senior, or graduate student. everyone, regardless of major, gender, race, etc., can sign up to be a bit or byte! sign up to be a bit/byte by september 2nd at https://go.illinoiswcs.org/bits-bytes-signup and we will match you with your new family! families will be your personal resource throughout the year. it is up to you how you want to spend your time with them. it might be at a wcs event, random zoom call, game night, or anything! cs mental health committee (csmhc): the cs mental health committee is a student organization dedicated to promoting dialogue and improving mental health resources for students in the community. you might know us from our mental health awareness nights, de-stressing events, or our mindfulness monday posts on social media (shameless plug:Â @csmhc.illinois)! we even worked on the senate initiative to get cr/nc grading in the fall 2020 semester . this year, we are hosting a newÂ mental health forumÂ for students to discuss challenges they may be experiencing with mental health, look for campus resources , and hear from peers about tips around well-being and self-care, as well as a new faculty mental health ambassador program to create more mental health-friendly course policies and dialogue in classes.
