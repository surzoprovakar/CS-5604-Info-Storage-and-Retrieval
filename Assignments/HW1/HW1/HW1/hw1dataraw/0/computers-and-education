home research research areas computers and education about faculty research groups/events related news computing has a large and growing impact on education. it is improving classroom interactivity, increasing accessibility, facilitating personalized learning inside and outside the classroom, and providing a platform for exploring fundamental questions about how people learn. at the same time, demand for computer science education is skyrocketing world-wide. reaching larger and more diverse audiences requires both understanding how people learn computer science and creating best practices for teaching specific computing topics. our faculty study broadly in both of these facets of computers and education. we build new systems, run them at scale, and design interfaces and study the human impacts of technology in the classroom. we gather and analyze data about student behavior to better understand the learning process using both data science techniques and qualitative research. faculty
